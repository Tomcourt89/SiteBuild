Hello!

Some information on the developer test

We’ve included less.js to allow you to work with that locally should you need to. Applying styling to the styles.less file within the styles folder if you wish to use Less. Be aware though due to a known issue it won’t work in chrome, so use another preferred browser if going down this route! If you are to not use LessCSS you can add standard CSS to the siteStyle.css file within the styles folder

Need any further documentation on less.js you can find it here: http://lesscss.org/

We would like you to integrate a fully responsive web page creation to meet the design supplied - using the assets at your disposal. We do not need sub pages created for navigational and link purposes but if you feel this will aid your integration then feel free to do so. Items should exist though as links in areas such as navigation links in the header. The blocks. Links could simply link to https://www.simplevieweurope.com/

The page styling should be generated via the CSS or LessCSS methods as described. And all the core HTML created within the index.html file provided. Javascript or a Jquery plugin may be used in order to integrate in any functional aspects to the flat design that needs integrating.

What we will not accept is solutions created from CSS/HTML frameworks. The core HTML created and styling should be your own. With responsive breakpoints added to style correctly for mobile.

There are some links to the required fonts and style guide below. The style guide should have all the information you need for all aspects of the design.
